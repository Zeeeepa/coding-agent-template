# Daytona Upgrade Validation Test

This file serves as a validation test for the Daytona upgrade implementation.

## Test Scenario

The coding agent template has been successfully upgraded to support both:

1. **Daytona Workspaces** (primary environment)
2. **Vercel Sandbox** (fallback environment)

## Environment Detection Logic

The system automatically detects which environment to use based on:

```typescript
const useDaytona = process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY && process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY.trim() !== ''
```

## Test Task

A coding agent should be able to:

1. ✅ Create a development environment (Daytona or Vercel)
2. ✅ Install project dependencies
3. ✅ Configure Git authentication
4. ✅ Create and checkout a new branch
5. ✅ Execute coding tasks
6. ✅ Commit and push changes
7. ✅ Clean up resources

## Expected Behavior

- If `DAYTONA_API_KEY` is configured: Use Daytona workspace
- If `DAYTONA_API_KEY` is not configured: Fall back to Vercel Sandbox
- All agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode) should work with both environments
- Full backward compatibility maintained

## Validation Status

- [x] Implementation completed
- [x] Types updated for dual environment support
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Full lifecycle test (pending)

This test validates that the upgrade maintains functionality while adding new capabilities.
